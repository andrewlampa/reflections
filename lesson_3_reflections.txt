When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you want to collaborate with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might be committing changes over a period of time and automatic pulls
    would make your commits public even if you intended to only make the sum
    of future commits public.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are when you want to edit the repository of someone else's. Clones are
    duplicates of repositories. Branches are pointers connecting commits. Forks
    are useful when you want to add on to someone else's project, clones for
    duplicating repositories locally or from a remote, and branches for when
    you want to work on adding extra features to your project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
